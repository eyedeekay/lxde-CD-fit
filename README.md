LXDE Install Media that fits on a CD
------------------------------------

This is a minimal LXDE install media that will fit on a 700MB CD-R. You make it
by running:

        make build

which will result in a cd image named lxde-min-amd64.hybrid.iso in the parent
directory. It has lxde-desktop packages, KDE's apper app store, Firefox, the
GIMP, and KODI media center.
